# UCI-CS143A-Operating-Systems
Created CPU scheduling simulations for my Operating Systems class.

Winter Quarter of 2014. Under Professor Nalini Venkatasubramanian. Simulated CPU scheduling algorithms such as Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), First Come First Serve (FCFS), Proportional Share (PS), and Round Robin (RR). Written purely in Java. Done over the course of 5 weeks.
